# Intent-Detection-for-Travel-Chatbots
This project implements a machine learning-based solution for intent detection in a travel assistant chatbot. The goal is to classify user messages into predefined intent categories such as "translate", "travel alert", "flight status", "lost luggage", and others, enabling the chatbot to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.
